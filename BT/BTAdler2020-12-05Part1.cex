      <p>
         This is the book of travels, which was compiled by <persName xml:id="recogito-086c8115-7e43-4f3f-ae4d-549dfc0f5410">Rabbi Benjamin</persName>, the
         son of <persName xml:id="recogito-b100b332-712d-42ff-95b3-33d9de17339c">Jonah</persName>, of the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-0bce778c-e196-4694-8130-988d0d725d35">Navarre</placeName>--his repose be in Paradise.
         The said <persName xml:id="recogito-59cd30b2-103c-42de-89dd-8d73c2ee61b5">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> set forth from <placeName xml:id="recogito-c53868dc-832a-4aa4-87dd-ca36406fb685">Tudela</placeName>, his native city, and
         passed through many remote countries, as is related in his book. In
         every place which he entered, he made a record of all that he saw, or
         was told of by trustworthy persons--matters not previously heard of in
         the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-f67aebdb-5956-42da-91b0-4ba055b46aea">Sepharad</placeName>[1]. Also he mentions some of the sages and
         illustrious men residing in each place. He brought this book with him
         on his return to the country of <placeName xml:id="recogito-099d13ee-1299-4a5c-b2f7-f21a24b455d0">Castile</placeName>, in the year 4933 (C.E.
         1173)[2]. The said <persName xml:id="recogito-992314b8-8925-4bb6-b5f0-b4d8f1a99025">Rabbi Benjamin</persName> is a wise and understanding man,
         learned in the Law and the Halacha, and wherever we have tested his
         statements we have found them accurate, true to fact and consistent;
         for he is a trustworthy man.

               workmen at fixed wages; and there were twenty men who brought the stones from the

               of the cave and smote them, and they fell to the ground like dead men, and there they
               lay until evening. And there came forth a wind like a man's voice, crying out: "Arise
               and go forth from this place!" So the men rushed forth in terror, and they came unto
