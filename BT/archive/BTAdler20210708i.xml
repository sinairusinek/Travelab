                    commanded the overseer to take the stones of the old walls and restore therewith
                    the church. He did so, and hired workmen at fixed wages; and there were twenty
                    men who brought the stones from the base of the wall of Zion. Among these men
                    there were two who were sworn friends. On a certain day the one entertained the

                    them, "Why have you tarried to-day?" They answered, "Why need you complain? When
                    our fellow workmen go to their meal we will do our work." When the dinner-time
                    arrived, and the other workmen had gone to their meal, they examined the stones,
                    and raised a certain stone which formed the entrance to a cave. Thereupon one
                    said to the other, "Let us go in and see if any money is to be found there."
                    They entered the cave, and reached a large chamber resting upon pillars of
                    marble overlaid with silver and gold. <pb n="39"/> In front was a table of gold
                    and a sceptre and crown. This was the sepulchre of King David. On the left
                    thereof in like fashion was the sepulchre of King <persName

                    then followed the sepulchres of all the kings of <placeName xml:id="temp0305" ana="hasparallel">Judah</placeName> that
                    were buried there. Closed coffers were also there, the contents of which no man
                    knows. The two men essayed to enter the chamber, when a fierce wind came forth
                    from the entrance of the cave and smote them, and they fell to the ground like
                    dead men, and there they lay until evening. And there came forth a wind like a
                    man's voice, crying out: "Arise and go forth from this place!" So the men rushed
                    forth in terror, and they came unto the Patriarch, and related these things to
                    him. Thereupon the Patriarch sent for Rabbi <persName

                    Rabbi Abraham replied, "These are the <placeName xml:id="temp0308" >sepulchres of the House of David</placeName>; they
                    belong to the kings of Judah, and on the

                    lying on his bed in terror, and the men said: "We will not enter there, for the
                    Lord doth not desire to show it to any man." Then the Patriarch gave orders that
                    the place should be closed up and hidden from the sight of man unto this day.

                    his brothers and the members of his family has an abode in his palace, but they
                    are all fettered in chains of iron, and guards are placed over each of their
                    houses so that they may not rise against the great Caliph. For once it happened
                    to a predecessor that his brothers rose up against him and proclaimed one of
                    themselves as Caliph; then it was decreed that all the members of his family
                    should be bound, that they might not rise up against the ruling Caliph. Each one
                    of them resides in his palace in great splendour, and they own villages and
                    towns, and their stewards bring them the tribute thereof, and they eat and drink
                    and rejoice all the days of their life<note n="125"/>. Within the domains of the
                    palace of the Caliph there are great buildings of marble and columns of silver
                    and gold, and carvings upon rare stones are fixed in the walls. <pb n="57"/> In
                    the Caliph's palace are great riches and towers filled with gold, silken

                    with all kinds of song and exultation, and they dance before the great king who
                    is styled the Caliph. They salute him with a loud voice and say, "Peace unto
                    thee, our Lord the King and Light of Islam!" He kisses his robe, and stretching
                    forth the hem thereof he salutes them. Then he proceeds to the court of the
                    mosque, mounts a wooden pulpit and expounds to them their Law. Then the learned
                    ones of Islam arise and pray for him and extol his greatness and his
                    graciousness, to which they all respond. Afterwards he gives them his blessing,
                    and they bring before him a camel which he slays, and this is their
                    passover-sacrifice. He gives thereof unto the princes and they distribute it to
                    all, so that they may taste of the sacrifice brought by their sacred king; and
                    they all rejoice. Afterwards he leaves the mosque and returns alone to his

                    and the grandees of Islam accompany him in ships on the river until he enters

                    along the river-side is watched all the year through, so that no man shall tread

                    smote it with the edge of the sword, took all the spoil thereof, and returned by

                        <placeName xml:id="temp0738">Persia</placeName> for many years. When the king
                    of <placeName xml:id="temp0739">Persia</placeName> heard thereof his anger was
                    kindled against them, and he said, "Not in my days nor in the days of my fathers
                    did an army sally forth from this wilderness. Now I will go and cut off their
                    name from the earth." A proclamation was made throughout his Empire, and he
                    assembled all his armies; and he sought a guide who might show him the way to
                    their encampment. And a certain man said that he would show him the way, as he
                    was one of them. And the king promised that he would enrich him if he did so.
                    And the king asked him as to what provisions they would require for the march
                    through the wilderness. <pb n="85"/> And he replied, "Take with you bread and
                    wine for fifteen days, for you will find no sustenance by the way, till you have
                    reached their land." And they did so, and marched through the wilderness for
                    fifteen days, but they found nothing at all. And their food began to give out,
                    so that man and beast were dying of hunger and thirst. Then the king called the
                    guide, and said to him, "Where is your promise to us that you would find our
                    adversaries?" To which the other replied, "I have mistaken the way." And the
                    king was wroth, and commanded that his head should be struck off. And the king
                    further gave orders throughout the camp that every man who had any food should
                    divide it with his neighbour. And they consumed everything they had including
                    their beasts. And after a further thirteen days' march they reached the
                    mountains of <placeName xml:id="temp0740">Naisabur</placeName>, where Jews lived.
                    They came there on the Sabbath, and encamped in the gardens and plantations and
                    by the springs of water which are by the side of the river <placeName
                        xml:id="temp0741">Gozan</placeName>. Now it was the time of the ripening of
                    the fruit, and they ate and consumed everything. No man came forth to them, but
                    on the mountains they saw cities and many towers. <pb n="86"/> Then the king
                    commanded two of his servants to go and inquire of the people who lived in the
                    mountains, and to cross the river either in boats or by swimming. So they
                    searched and found a large bridge, on which there were three towers, but the
                    gate of the bridge was locked. And on the other side of the bridge was a great
                    city. Then they shouted in front of the bridge till a man came forth and asked
                    them what they wanted and who they were. But they did not understand him till an
                    interpreter came who understood their language. And when he asked them, they
                    said, "We are the servants of the king of <placeName xml:id="temp0742"
                        >Persia</placeName>, and we have come to ask who you are, and whom you
                    serve." To which the other replied: "We are Jews; we have no king and no Gentile
                    prince, but a Jewish prince rules over us." They then questioned him with regard
                    to the infidels, the sons of Ghuz of the Kofar-al-Turak, and he answered: "Truly
                    they are in league with us, and he who seeks to do them harm seeks our harm."
                    Then they went their way, and told the king of <placeName xml:id="temp0743"
                        >Persia</placeName>, who was much alarmed. And on a certain day the Jews
                    asked him to join combat with them, but he answered: "I am not come to fight
                    you, but the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and if you fight against me I will be
                    avenged on you by killing all the Jews in my Empire; I know that you are
                    stronger than I am in this place, and my army has come out of this great
                    wilderness starving and athirst. Deal kindly with me and do not fight against
                    me, but leave me to engage with the Kofar-al-Turak, my enemy, and sell me also
                    the provisions which I require for myself and my army." <pb n="87"/> The Jews
                    then took counsel together, and resolved to propitiate the king on account of
                    the Jews who were in exile in his Empire. Then the king entered their land with
                    his army, and stayed there fifteen days. And they showed him much honour, and
                    also sent a dispatch to the Kofar-al-Turak their allies, reporting the matter to
                    them. Thereupon the latter occupied the mountain passes in force with a large
                    army composed of all those who dwelt in that desert, and when the king of
                        <placeName xml:id="temp0748">Persia</placeName> went forth to fight with
                    them, they placed themselves in battle array against him. The Kofar-al-Turak
                    army was victorious and slew many of the Persian host, and the king of
                        <placeName xml:id="temp0751">Persia</placeName> fled with only a few
                    followers to his own country<note n="169"/>. <pb n="88"/> Now a horseman, one of

                    them could be found to draw the bow like this <persName

                    Then the king inquired of him by means of an interpreter who knew his language,
                    and he related all that the horseman had done to him. Thereupon the king at once
                    granted him his liberty, had him clad in robes of silk, gave him gifts, and said
                    to him, "If thou wilt embrace our religion, I will make thee a rich man and
                    steward of my house," but he answered, "My lord, I cannot do this thing." Then
                    the king took him and placed him in the house of the Chief Rabbi of the

                    before the King, whereupon the King makes himself responsible even for their
                    property which they leave in the open, unprotected. There is an official who
                    sits in his office, and the owner of any lost property has only to describe it
                    to him when he hands it back. This custom prevails in all that country. From
                    Passover to New Year, that is all during the summer, no man can go out of his
                    house because of the sun, for the heat in that country is intense, and from the
                    third hour of the day onward, everybody remains in his house till the evening.
                    Then they go forth and kindle lights in all the market places and all the
                    streets, and then do their work and business at night-time. <pb n="91"/> For
                    they have to turn night into day in consequence of the great heat of the sun.
                    Pepper is found there. They plant the trees thereof in the fields, and each man
                    of the city knows his own plantation. The trees are small, and the pepper is as
                    white as snow. And when they have collected it, they place it in saucepans and
                    pour boiling water over it, so that it may become strong. They then take it out
                    of the water and dry it in the sun, and it turns black. Calamus and ginger and
                    many other kinds of spice are found in this land. The people of this country do
                    not bury their dead, but embalm them by means of various spices, after which
                    they place them on chairs and cover them with fine linen. And each family has a
                    house where it preserves the embalmed remains of its ancestors and relations.
                    The flesh hardens on the bones, and the embalmed bodies look like living beings,
                    so that every man can recognize his parents, and the members of his family for
                    many years. <pb n="92"/> They worship the sun, and they have high places
                    everywhere outside the city at a distance of about half a mile. And every
                    morning they run forth to greet the sun, for on every high place a solar disc is
                    made of cunning workmanship and as the sun rises the disc rotates with
                    thundering noise, and all, both men and women, offer incense to the sun with
                    censers in their hands. Such are their superstitious practices. And throughout
                    the island, including all the towns there, live several thousand Israelites. The
                    inhabitants are all black, and the Jews also. The latter are good and
                    benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent
                    the Talmud and Halacha.</seg>

                    fire-worshippers, and are called Duchbin. Among them are about 3,000 Jews, and
                    these Duchbin have priests in their several temples who are great wizards in all
                    manner of witchcraft, and there are none like them in all the earth. In front of
                    the high place of their temple there is a deep trench, where they keep a great
                    fire alight all the year, and they call it Elahutha. <pb n="93"/> And they cause
                    their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, and even their dead they
                    throw into it. Some of the great men of the country make a vow to die by fire.
                    In such cases the man communicates his intention to the members of his household
                    and his relations, and says:--"I have vowed to throw myself in the fire whilst I
                    am yet alive," then they answer, saying: "Happy art thou." And when the day of
                    the performance of his vow arrives, they prepare for him a grand banquet, and if
                    he is rich he rides on horseback, if poor he goes on foot to the border of the
                    trench and throws himself into the fire. And all the members of his family shout
                    to the accompaniment of timbrels and dancing until the body is entirely
                    consumed. At the end of three days two of their high priests come to his house
                    and to his children and say unto them: "Arrange the house, for this day your
                    father will come to give his last directions as to what ye shall do." And they
                    bring witnesses from the city. Then Satan is made to appear in the likeness of
                    the deceased, and when his widow and children ask him how he fares in the other
                    world he answers: "I went to my companions, but they would not receive me until
                    I had discharged my obligations to the members of my house and to my
                    neighbours." <pb n="94"/> Then he makes his will and divides his property among
                    his children, and gives directions that all his creditors should be paid and
                    that his debts should be collected. Then the witnesses write out the will, and
                    he goes his way and is seen no more. And by means of this trickery and
                    witchcraft which these priests practise, the people are confirmed in their
                    errors and assert that there is none in all the land like their priests.</seg>

                    the water only covers half the extent of the land. And day by day an officer
                    takes a measurement on the column and makes proclamation thereof in <placeName

                    which is the land of <placeName xml:id="temp0840">Havilah</placeName>, much rain
                    descends at the time of the rising of the river, and that this abundance of rain
                    causes the river to rise and to cover the surface of the land<note n="188"/>. If
                    the river does not rise, there is no sowing, and famine is sore in the land.
                    Sowing is done in the month of Marheshwan, after the river has gone back to its
                    ordinary channel. In the month of Adar is the barley-harvest, and in the month
                    of Nisan the wheat-harvest. In the month of Nisan they have cherries, pears,
                    cucumbers, and gourds in plenty, also beans, peas, chickpeas, and many kinds of
                    vegetables, such as purslane, asparagus, pulse, lettuce, coriander, endive,
                    cabbage, leek, and cardoon. The land is full of all good things, and the gardens
                    and plantations are watered from the various reservoirs and by the
