# Travelab
Travel itineraries provide a rare and fascinating window to the daily lives and cultures of historical periods, aspects which are not always accessible to us through other literary genres. The project will feature the Medieval travel narratives of Benjamin of Tudela and Petachia of Regensburg; selected early modern itineraries and the 19th century  journey of ‘Benjamin the Second’. We strive to:
Create a interface for study, enrichment and reading of the itineraries
Explore the ways in which a generous and flexible interface can combine close and distant reading in parallel editions and maps.
