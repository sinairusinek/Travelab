235	235	And as the Eu- phrates, when it rose, inundated the grave, they took of the money vowed by Jews and Ishmaelites and built a city round his grave, with towers in the midst of the wateR. There is a beautiful house over his grave, which the Ishmaelites call Chinuk (Choking).	And

286	286	Formerly the horses used to be startled back at the sight of the gates, for seeing the brightness of the gates they perceived as it were other horses running towards them, whereby they took fright and started off.	Formerly

	286		horses
	286		used
	286		to

	286		fright
	286		and
	286		started
	286		off
	286		.
287	287	They therefore poured boiling vinegar over the gates, and thus deadened the brightness of the polished copper, so that the horses should enteR. However, the polish of the copper is still partly perceived at the top, where no vinegar was poured.	They
	287		therefore
	287		poured
	287		boiling
	287		vinegar
	287		over

	287		should
	287		enter

	287		the
