148	The monarch who reigned in the days of Rabbi Shelomoh, father of Rabbi Daniel, was a friend of Rabbi Shelomoh, because the monarch was of the seed of Mahomet, and the head of the captivity descended from King David.	148	The

149	And he said to Rabbi Shelomoh that he wished to see the prophet Ezekiel, who performed miracles.	149	And

150	And Rabbi Shelomoh said to him, Thou canst not see him, for he is holy, nor must thou uncover his grave.	150	And

151	The monarch replied that he would explore it.	151	The

152	Then Rabbi Shelomoh and the elders said to him, My lord and king, Baruch, son of Neriah, his disciple,41 is buried near the enclosure of the prophet.	152	Then
		152	Rabbi
		152	Shelomoh

		152	My

153	If it be thy will uncover his grave.	153	If

154	If thou canst see his disciple then thou mayest try to see his master.	154	If

155	He then assembled all the princes, and commanded them to dig.	155	He
		155	then
		155	assembled
		155	all
		155	the
		155	princes

		155	and
		155	commanded

156	But every one that dug into the grave of Baruch, son of Neriah, fell down immediately and died.	156	But
		156	every

		156	,
		156	fell
		156	down
		156	immediately
		156	and
		156	died
		156	.
157	There was there an old man, an Ishmaelite, who said to the monarch, Tell the Jews that they should dig.	157	There
		157	was
		157	there
		157	an
		157	old
		157	man
		157	,
		157	an

		157	,
		157	who
		157	said

		157	,
		157	Tell
		157	the
		157	Jews
		157	that
		157	they
		157	should
		157	dig
		157	.
158	The Jews replied, We are afraid.	158	The
		158	Jews
		158	replied
		158	,
		158	We
		158	are
		158	afraid
		158	.
159	But the king said, If you keep the law of Baruch, son of Neriah, he will not hurt you, for every Ishmaelite that dug fell down dead.	159	But
		159	the
		159	king
		159	said
		159	,
		159	If
		159	you
		159	keep
		159	the
		159	law
		159	of
		159	Baruch
		159	,
		159	son

		159	,
		159	he
		159	will

		159	down
		159	dead
		159	.
160	Then Rabbi Shelomoh said, Give us time, three days, that we may fast in order to obtain his pardon.	160	Then
		160	Rabbi
		160	Shelomoh
		160	said
		160	,
		160	Give

161	After three days the Jews dug, and were not hurt.	161	After

162	The coffin of Baruch, son of Neriah, was between two marble stones, he being between the two.	162	The

163	A portion of his praying scarf42 protruded between the stones.	163	A

164	The king said, No two kings make use of the same crown.43	164	The

165	It does not become this righteous man to be near Ezekiel.	165	It

209	Then a Jew said to him, The horse came here in a miraculous manner; you may perhaps have vowed it to the saint.	209	Then
		209	a
		209	Jew
		209	said
		209	to

		209	,
		209	The

		209	came
		209	here

		209	a
		209	miraculous
		209	manner
		209	;
		209	you

		209	vowed
		209	it
		209	to
		209	the
		209	saint
		209	.
210	He confessed it, and said, Yes, I have vowed it to him, and what shall I do to be able to bring it out ? The Jew said, Take money and lay it on his grave.	210	He
		210	confessed
		210	it
		210	,
		210	and
		210	said
		210	,
		210	Yes
		210	,
		210	I
		210	have
		210	vowed
		210	it
		210	to
		210	him
		210	,
		210	and
		210	what
		210	shall
		210	I
		210	do
		210	to
		210	be
		210	able
		210	to
		210	bring
		210	it
		210	out
		210	?
		210	The
		210	Jew
		210	said
		210	,
		210	Take
		210	money
		210	and
		210	lay
		210	it
		210	on
		210	his
		210	grave
		210	.
211	If you lay down its value the horse will be able to go forth.	211	If
		211	you
		211	lay
		211	down
		211	its

		211	.
212	He gradually increased the amount of the money until it reached the value, when the entrance became enlarged, and it could go forth.	212	He
		212	gradually
		212	increased
		212	the
		212	amount

213	Rabbi Petachia went to the grave of Ezekiel, and took with him gold, and gold grains, and the grains fell from his hands, and he said, My Lord Ezekiel, for thy honour have I come, and now the grains have dropped from my hands and are lost.	213	Rabbi

215	And he saw something, at some distance, like a star. 	215	And

		215	saw
		215	something
		215	,
		215	at
		215	some

217	He then went there and found the grains, when he placed them on the tomb of Ezekiel.	217	He

218	Every Ishmaelite that goes in pilgrimage to the tomb of Mahomet takes his way over the tomb of Ezekiel, and makes some present or free-will offering to Ezekiel, making a vow and praying, Our Lord Ezekiel, if I return I will give thee such and such a thing.	218	Every

220	Whoever wishes to go to a distant land deposits his purse, or any valuables, with Ezekiel, saying, Our Lord Ezekiel, take charge of this valuable for me until I return, and let nobody take it but its heir. 	220	Whoever

222	There were books there, and a worthless person wished to carry away one of the books, but could not, for pain and blindness seized him; therefore every one fears Ezekiel.	222	There

233	Whilst Rabbi Petachia was on the grave of Ezekiel he saw in the building a bird the face of which was like that of a human being,53 at which the overseer acting as doorkeeper grieved, for he said, It is a tradition with us, from our fathers, that every house wherein such a bird is found will become a ruin.	233	Whilst
		233	Rabbi
		233	Petachia
		233	was
		233	on
		233	the
		233	grave
		233	of
		233	Ezekiel
		233	he
		233	saw
		233	in
		233	the
		233	building
		233	a
		233	bird
		233	the
		233	face
		233	of
		233	which
		233	was
		233	like
		233	that
		233	of
		233	a
		233	human
		233	being
		233	,
		233	53
		233	at
		233	which
		233	the
		233	overseer
		233	acting
		233	as
		233	doorkeeper
		233	grieved
		233	,
		233	for
		233	he
		233	said
		233	,
		233	It
		233	is
		233	a
		233	tradition
		233	with
		233	us
		233	,
		233	from
		233	our

		233	wherein
		233	such
		233	a
		233	bird
		233	is
		233	found
		233	will
		233	become
		233	a
		233	ruin
		233	.
234	But when the overseer observed that as the bird was going to quit the window it turned and died, he rejoiced greatly, for he said that since the bird was dead the doom was annulled.	234	But
		234	when
		234	the
		234	overseer
		234	observed
		234	that
		234	as

		234	window
		234	it
		234	turned
		234	and
		234	died
		234	,
		234	he
		234	rejoiced
		234	greatly
		234	,
		234	for
		234	he
		234	said
		234	that
		234	since

		234	was
		234	dead
		234	the
		234	doom
		234	was

		234	.
235	The head of the academy told Rabbi Petachia that formerly a column of fire rested over the grave of Ezekiel,54 but that wicked persons had come and desecrated it, since there had come about 80,000 individuals to the feast of Tabernacles, among whom there were unworthy persons, and the column of fire was removed.	235	The
		235	head
		235	of
		235	the

		235	had
		235	come
		235	and

		235	,
		235	000
		235	individuals
		235	to

		235	the

		235	of
		235	fire
		235	was
		235	removed
		235	.
236	The Tabernacles are erected in the same enclosure, close to the burial ground.33	236	The

237	The river Euphrates and the river Chabo55 join; they can nevertheless be distinguished.	237	The

251	And as the Euphrates, when it rose, inundated the grave, they took of the money vowed by Jews and Ishmaelites and built a city round his grave, with towers in the midst of the water.	251	And

253	The reason thereof is that one day the sultan came and took away one of the 35 stones forming one of the steps leading to his grave.	253	The
		253	reason
		253	thereof
		253	is
		253	that

254	But in the night Rabbi Meir appeared to him in a dream, seized him by the throat as though he was going to choke him, saying to him, Why didst thou carry away my stone ? 	254	But
		254	in
		254	the
		254	night
		254	Rabbi
		254	Meir
		254	appeared
		254	to

		254	in

		254	,
		254	seized

		254	by
		254	the

		254	,
		254	saying

		254	,
		254	Why
		254	didst
		254	thou
		254	carry
		254	away
		254	my
		254	stone
		254	?
255	Dost thou not know that I am righteous, and beloved by God ? 	255	Dost
		255	thou
		255	not

		255	that
		255	I

		255	?
256	The sultan then begged the rabbi’s pardon.	256	The
		256	sultan
		256	then
		256	begged
		256	the
		256	rabbi’s
		256	pardon
		256	.
257	But he replied, I will not do so until thou earnest it back on thy own shoulder, before the eyes of all, saying, I was wicked in robbing my lord the righteous.	257	But
		257	he
		257	replied
		257	,
		257	I
		257	will
		257	not
		257	do
		257	so
		257	until
		257	thou
		257	earnest
		257	it
		257	back
		257	on
		257	thy
		257	own
		257	shoulder
		257	,
		257	before
		257	the
		257	eyes
		257	of
		257	all
		257	,
		257	saying
		257	,
		257	I
		257	was
		257	wicked
		257	in
		257	robbing
		257	my
		257	lord
		257	the
		257	righteous
		257	.
258	In the morrow he carried the stone on his shoulder and put it on its former place, saying, I was wicked in robbing my lord the righteous.	258	In
		258	the
		258	morrow
		258	he
		258	carried
		258	the
		258	stone
		258	on

		258	shoulder
		258	and

293	Originally he was buried on one side of the river, and there was there great plenty, prosperity, and blessing.	293	Originally

294	Then those on the other side of the river said, Because the righteous man is not buried in our portion therefore our district is not blessed.	294	Then

295	And there were constantly great wars between the two districts, during which the coffin was violently transferred from bank to bank.	295	And

296	At last some elders came, who having brought about a settlement between them, they took the coffin and suspended it by iron chains, on high iron pillars, erected in the middle of the river.	296	At

297	The coffin is made of polished copper conspicuous in the middle of the river ten cubits above the water.	297	The

299	The Jews told him that any vessel passing underneath the coffin will proceed in safety if those in it be pious, but will founder if this be not the case.	299	The
		299	Jews
		299	told

300	He was further told that underneath the coffin there are fish with golden pendants in their ears.70	300	He

301	He, however, did not pass underneath the coffin, but stood on the brink of the river looking at the coffin.	301	He

302	He then returned to Bagdad.	302	He
		302	then

303	There he was shown a flying camel.71	303	There

304	It is low, and its legs are slender; and if anybody wishes to ride on it, he must tie himself to it lest he should fall down.	304	It
		304	is

305	The rider traverses in one day the space over which a man on foot would have to pass fifteen days.	305	The

311	A nail once fell out, and no artificer is able to fix it again.	311	A

312	Formerly the horses used to be startled back at the sight of the gates, for seeing the brightness of the gates they perceived as it were other horses running towards them, whereby they took fright and started off.	312	Formerly
		312	the
		312	horses
		312	used
		312	to
		312	be
		312	startled

		312	the

		312	they

		312	,
		312	whereby
		312	they
		312	took
		312	fright
		312	and
		312	started
		312	off
		312	.
313	They therefore poured boiling vinegar over the gates, and thus deadened the brightness of the polished copper, so that the horses should enter.	313	They
		313	therefore
		313	poured
		313	boiling
		313	vinegar
		313	over
		313	the

		313	,
		313	and

		313	the
		313	brightness
		313	of
		313	the
		313	polished
		313	copper
		313	,
		313	so
		313	that
		313	the
		313	horses
		313	should
		313	enter
		313	.
314	However, the polish of the copper is still partly perceived at the top, where no vinegar was poured.	314	However
		314	,
		314	the

		314	of
		314	the

371	The ark of Noah was carried between these mountains and could not get out.	371	The

373	The mountains are full of thorns and other herbs; when the dew falls upon them, manna falls upon them, but when the sun shines warm it melts.	373	The

375	They therefore carry off the manna together with the thorns and herbs, which they are obliged to cut off, since they are very hard.	375	They

381	They gave him a few to taste; they melted in his mouth; they were sweet; penetrating into all his limbs, so that he could not bear the sweetness.81	381	They

383	The king, contemporaneous with Rabbi Shelomoh, father of Rabbi Daniel, head of the captivity, having seen51 the brightness ascending from the grave of Baruch, son of Neriah, and whose beautiful and splendid praying scarf was faintly visible between the marble stones, went afterwards to the city of Meccah, to the tomb of Mahomet ;83 and behold there was a decayed and putrefied corpse, from whose grave such a disagreeable smell arose that nobody could bear it.	383	The

384	He then said to his people that there was nothing substantial either in Mahomet or his religion, for they knew that the body of Baruch, son of Neriah, was preserved, that his praying scarf protruded from his tomb, that he was a disciple to a prophet, and that the Ishmaelites who dug up his grave perished, whilst the Jews were not hurt; therefore we may know that the Jews hold by the law kept by Baruch, son of Neriah.	384	He

489	The Jews of Acco had told him previously, Beware, for they have placed three corpses at the entrance of the cave, saying that these were the patriarchs; but they are not.	489	The

491	He, therefore, gave him another gold piece to take him inside the cave.	491	He

492	He then opened it, saying, I never permitted a Gentile before to enter this gate.	492	He

496	The ground consists all of rock; and all the graves are in the hollow of the rock; and over that entrance, in the middle, are placed very thick iron bars, the like no man can make unless through heavenly instrumentality, and a storm-wind blows from between the holes between bar and bar.	496	The

499	Whenever he bent towards65 the mouth of the cave a storm-wind went forth and cast him backwards.	499	Whenever
