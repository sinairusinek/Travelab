travelled through all the countries. He set out from

have no ships, but sew together ten extended horse hides,
and a thong on the border round; they then seat them¬
selves on the hides, placing there also the waggons and
all luggage. They then tie the thong, on the border of
the hides, to the tails of the horses, which swim, and thus
they pass over the water. They eat no bread in the land
of <placeName xml:id="recogito-fd5f5601-c54b-4d7f-bd49-2c2ae2021c48" cert="unknown">Kedar</placeName>, but rice and millet boiled in milk, as well as
milk and cheese. They also put pieces of flesh under the</p>
            

            <pb n="5"/>
<p>
saddle of a horse, which they ride, and, urging on the
animal, cause it to sweat. The flesh getting warm, they
eat it. They only travel in the land of <placeName xml:id="recogito-798af0b0-be99-4ebc-ae40-046874c4a16d" cert="unknown">Kedar</placeName> under es¬
cort. This is the manner in which the sons of <placeName xml:id="recogito-78ced082-430f-4172-95d4-e2a2810d8ff7" cert="unknown">Kedar</placeName>
pledge their faith to each other. One thrusts a needle
into his finger, and invites the intended companion of his
journey to swallow the blood of the wounded finger. He
then becomes, with the person, as it were the same blood
and flesh. There is also another mode of taking an oath.
They fill a vessel of cast copper of the shape of a human
face, then the traveller and his escorter drink thereout,
after which he never proves faithless to him. They have
no king, but only princes and (noble) families.</p>

The monarch who reigned in the days of Rabbi She-
lomoh, father of Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-a836456c-cfe4-4f1a-9479-e49b66308b41">Daniel</persName>, was a friend of Rabbi She-
lomoh, because the monarch was of the seed of <persName xml:id="recogito-ee134f5e-5dad-445e-96dc-a06c2321a106">Mahomet</persName>,
and the head of the captivity descended from King <persName xml:id="recogito-dc929c55-6f64-4157-b576-c4021d16fa42">David</persName>.
And he said to <persName xml:id="recogito-297474f4-e4b4-4eba-81e4-5608cffa04d8">Rabbi Shelomoh</persName> that he wished to see the
prophet <persName xml:id="recogito-41fc5471-aef9-4845-beff-3ece9a2d08b0">Ezekiel</persName>, who performed miracles. And <persName xml:id="recogito-d41fb219-fefa-4b5a-9fa9-2e3bee03bbaf">Rabbi Shelomoh</persName> said to him, Thou canst not see him, for he is
holy, nor must thou uncover his grave. The monarch
replied that he would explore it. Then Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-827851f8-1b36-498d-a310-4bc045678e87">Shelomoh</persName>
and the elders said to him, My lord and king, <persName xml:id="recogito-7388b0e5-b914-4854-8655-c6761b08edad">Baruch,
son of Neriah</persName>, his disciple,<note n="41"/> is buried near the enclosure of
the prophet. If it be thy will uncover his grave. If thou
canst see his disciple then thou mayest try to see his mas¬
ter. He then assembled all the princes, and commanded
them to dig. But every one that dug into the <placeName xml:id="recogito-b3356a00-e350-4356-8306-56c4d1e921a3" cert="low">grave of
Baruch, son of Neriah</placeName>, fell down immediately and died.
There was there an old man, an Ishmaelite, who said to
the monarch, Tell the Jews that they should dig. The
Jews replied, We are afraid. But the king said, If
you keep the law of Baruch, son of Neriah, he will not hurt
you, for every Ishmaelite that dug fell down dead. Then
Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-8c108e2a-5b64-4327-8434-4ee760bbdc4e">Shelomoh</persName> said, Give us time, three days, that we
may fast in order to obtain his pardon. After three days
the Jews dug, and were not hurt. The coffin of <persName xml:id="recogito-1d8b5be6-0b08-4d9b-92cf-2f490f6b7ebb">Baruch,
son of Neriah</persName>, was between two marble stones, he being

truded between the stones. The king said, No two kings
make use of the same crown.<note n="43"/> It does not become this
righteous man to be near <persName xml:id="recogito-8c7957f6-04e3-4eb8-94c2-0d1358e7aaf9">Ezekiel</persName>. I will transfer it to ano¬

together with the coffin. When they came at the distance
of a mile from the grave of <persName xml:id="recogito-22954d5e-8723-4b85-bb43-c1a9fd7a7705">Ezekiel</persName>, they could not stir from
the place. Nor could any horses or mules move the coffin
from its place. Then said <persName xml:id="recogito-35fb90c9-497f-4c80-a187-3dc6c3fd2aaa">Rabbi Shelomoh</persName>, Here the
righteous man wishes to be buried, and they buried there
the coffin, and built a beautiful palace over his grave.</p>

Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-a237787a-e544-4645-af7a-0590ca396b3f">Samuel</persName>, the head of the academy, gave <persName xml:id="recogito-594f9c36-f2e5-486b-9ecd-8ced16457ad1">Rabbi Pe - tachia</persName>a document with his seal, that they should give him

alogy. Before that city is a grave over which a beautiful
house is built. He was told that some rich man saw in
his dream an apparition, saying to him, I am a Jew whose
name is <persName xml:id="recogito-c3150530-06f6-49de-84e0-acdd4e1e1d1d">Brosak</persName>, one of the princes that went into captivity
with <persName xml:id="recogito-572c24f3-f8d9-423c-b66d-465b07c71a63">Jeconiah</persName>. I am righteous. Thou hast no children.
If thou wilt build a beautiful house over my grave thou
wilt have children. He built over it a house, and he had
children. They then put the question in a dream,<note n="47"/> to learn
who was buried there, and he said, I am <persName xml:id="recogito-72c90d23-c2a0-41e3-a27b-dc84bb9d25d1">Brosak</persName>, I have
no other name.</p>

<p>
And the priest appointed about fifty youths, armed with
spears and other weapons, who escorted him; for there is a
people in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="dare.ht.lu.se/places/22328" xml:id="recogito-3c4bfff4-002c-4ce7-b0e0-7a0363ece059" cert="high">Babel</placeName> which does not

the God of <persName xml:id="recogito-1bf07cf2-6ffb-49bf-ab01-f4c44edc200f">Ezekiel</persName>, and thus all the Ishmaelites call them.
About a day’s or half a day’s journey from <placeName ref="dare.ht.lu.se/places/33884" xml:id="recogito-c8a570ae-18cb-4fb3-b9f1-49e5753bf546" cert="high">Bagdad</placeName>, in the
desert, is the <placeName xml:id="recogito-4fbef023-f5ff-41f3-940b-9daad2d1ec7b" cert="unknown">grave of the prophet Ezekiel</placeName><note target="recogito-4fbef023-f5ff-41f3-940b-9daad2d1ec7b" resp="sinai">al Kifl, Iraq</note>. It is in the
possession of the Charamim. The city is about a mile
from the grave. The Jews possess the keys. Round the
grave of <persName xml:id="recogito-c9b5b17e-7d57-4a12-91da-74444fefc9dc">Ezekiel</persName> is a wall, and a large town, and a large
enclosure. The Jews open the wicket, which is so low
that those entering have to crawl on hands and feet. On
the festival of Tabernacles people from all countries resort
hither, when the entrance becomes enlarged by itself, so
that they can enter it even on camels. About 60,000 or
80,000 Jews meet there, besides Ishmaelites. Tabernacles</p>


            <pb n="27"/>
<p>
are erected in the enclosure of <persName xml:id="recogito-87df251c-eef1-4484-8ad1-f67727abb375">Ezekiel</persName>. Afterwards the
entrance shrinks to its former dimensions. All can see
that. Vows and free-will offerings take place over his
grave. And whoever is barren, or whose cattle is barren,
makes a vow, or prays over his grave. Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-b323b5a4-e75a-45ec-a821-8e4cfbe9bb3c">Petachia</persName>
was told that some person of distinction had a mare which
had become barren,<note n="50"/> and he vowed that if the mare would
bring forth a foal he would give it to <persName xml:id="recogito-03cbcd40-40e6-4ea1-9548-f2d4071d3c03">Ezekiel</persName>. His desire
was gratified. But as the foal was beautiful, he wished to
keep it for himself. But the foal left him of its own ac¬
cord, and went into the enclosure of <persName xml:id="recogito-765ff814-99a7-4a3a-b0ec-e2de750d091f">Ezekiel</persName>, through the
gate, which was enlarged for the purpose. The master
searched for the horse everywhere without finding it. At
last he considered that having vowed it to the righteous
<persName xml:id="recogito-14955a42-40e5-44b0-a7fa-36a28fcff2ac">Ezekiel</persName>, it might have gone there, and indeed he found it
there; but when he desired to take it away he could not,
for the entrance was too low. Then a Jew said to him,
The horse came here in a miraculous manner; you may
perhaps have vowed it to the saint. He confessed it, and
said, Yes, I have vowed it to him, and what shall I do to
be able to bring it out ? The Jew said, Take money and
lay it on his grave. If you lay down its value the horse
will be able to go forth. He gradually increased the
amount of the money until it reached the value, when the
entrance became enlarged, and it could go forth.</p>

<p>
Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-40fb9ab3-9ba1-4a77-b63b-3bd952bd40a9">Petachia</persName> went to the grave of <persName xml:id="recogito-2d60b86e-5af4-4bb3-be64-df512b21abee">Ezekiel</persName>, and took with
him gold, and gold grains, and the grains fell from his hands,
and he said, My Lord <persName xml:id="recogito-25237e85-5bfa-4de2-af34-f8a574f4e813">Ezekiel</persName>, for thy honour have I come,</p>

<p>
and now the grains have dropped from my hands and are
lost. Wherever they may be they are thine. And he saw
something, at some distance, like a star. He thought it
might be a precious stone. He then went there and found
the grains, when he placed them on the tomb of <persName xml:id="recogito-ce550266-76b3-41f7-8463-810a1ba47413">Ezekiel</persName>.

many purses with money lie there rotting because they lay

the eye never saw the like. There are windows in it,
through which people pass their heads and pray. At the

the inside. There are also in it beautiful glass vases, and</p>

They supply the olive oil from the gifts deposited for the

From the money deposited on his grave the synagogue re¬

saw in the building a bird the face of which was like that of
a human being,<note n="53"/> at which the overseer acting as doorkeeper
grieved, for he said, It is a tradition with us, from our fa¬

become a ruin. But when the overseer observed that as
the bird was going to quit the window it turned and died,
he rejoiced greatly, for he said that since the bird was
dead the doom was annulled. The head of the academy
told <persName xml:id="recogito-fc6c386f-ccfe-490a-9145-7f21780d1156">Rabbi Petachia</persName> that formerly a column of fire rested

buried there.<note n="56"/> He (Rabbi Petachia) then returned, and in
two days went as far as Nehardeah.<note n="57"/> The city has a cir¬
cuit of about three days; but everything is desolate.
There is a congregation in a portion of the city. And
when he produced the seal of the head of the academy
they showed him the synagogue Shaf-Wyathib.<note n="58"/> Its three
walls are of stone, and the western wall is on the river
<placeName ref="pleiades.stoa.org/places/912849" xml:id="recogito-8e2152bb-1603-4862-a4cf-b1bd41504cfb" cert="low">Euphrates</placeName>. No portion of the wall is built of either stone
or brick, but consists entirely of the dust which <persName xml:id="recogito-86c8452a-bdf9-42c6-8827-7b4928bd4f5a">Jechaniah</persName>
brought with him. The synagogue has no roof, for every¬
thing is desolate. And the Jews told him that in the
night they see a column of fire issue from it, extending as
far as the grave of Brusak, which he mentioned before.
He then returned, and came to a city called <placeName xml:id="recogito-478efbec-d0df-4167-a48a-a0d93c34c1ed" cert="unknown">Mella</placeName>,<note n="59"/> where
the grave of Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-ed7f0251-b3b4-4ada-8dcd-6994d12b9bb3">Meir</persName> is, the same Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-f8d36219-bac9-464d-b343-79b0a7a1dd5e">Meir</persName> men¬
tioned in the Mishnah.<note n="60"/> Before the town, by the water, is
a field, and in that field is the grave. And as the Eu-
phrates, when it rose, inundated the grave, they took of
the money vowed by Jews and Ishmaelites and built a city
round his grave, with towers in the midst of the water.
There is a beautiful house over his grave, which the Ish¬
maelites call <placeName xml:id="recogito-267533ab-82c5-4954-bf04-518178e84c50" cert="unknown">Chinuk</placeName> (Choking). The reason thereof is
that one day the <persName xml:id="recogito-2a29fe9e-2ca5-4f80-8fcc-280a6c93d638">sultan</persName> came and took away one of the</p>

<p>
stones forming one of the steps leading to his grave. But
in the night <persName xml:id="recogito-d9c04c2f-aaf8-4eca-8241-4b9e9efa255c">Rabbi Meir</persName> appeared to him in a dream,
seized him by the throat as though he was going to choke
him, saying to him, Why didst thou carry away my stone ?
<persName xml:id="recogito-233bc515-8530-451d-acd9-930856ae1d30">Dost</persName> thou not know that I am righteous, and beloved by
God ? The <persName xml:id="recogito-af10ac68-e27c-430a-8c79-1e04dd1bd3b5">sultan</persName> then begged the rabbi’s pardon. But
he replied, I will not do so until thou earnest it back on
thy own shoulder, before the eyes of all, saying, I was
wicked in robbing my lord the righteous. In the morrow
he carried the stone on his shoulder and put it on its
former place, saying, I was wicked in robbing my lord the
righteous. Therefore the Ishmaelites fear him, worship on
his grave, make him presents, and vow that if they should
return in peace they would give him this or that. Where¬
ever <persName xml:id="recogito-31c9c505-3b1e-4ae6-82e6-e1d2aa8584ee" ana="#typo">Rabbi Petachia</persName> showed the seal of the head of the

ists a congregation near the grave of a righteous man they
spread a costly cloth over the grave, and when they re¬

there is no building. Underneath most of the cloths or
mats covering the graves a serpent is coiled, which guards
the grave.<note n="66"/> Therefore they say to everyone, When thou
raisest the mat beware of the serpent. The head of the
academy wrote down for him who the Amoraim buried

turned to the east, and came in six days to the grave of
our lord <persName xml:id="recogito-6ef99f3f-c9f9-4ed5-bccf-733144ffb7d0">Ezra</persName>, the scribe. They said that in the days
of old the grave of <persName xml:id="recogito-91e32d30-e82c-4d45-b36b-df65d5bb5245">Ezra</persName>, the scribe, was ruinous. Once
a shepherd came, who saw a mound and slept on it.
Some one then appeared to him in a dream, saying to him,
Tell the <persName xml:id="recogito-b80c39ac-a179-481c-9795-d98748ce8d2a">sultan</persName> I am <persName xml:id="recogito-43cccf81-722e-444e-a3ed-e51491718e7b">Ezra</persName>, the scribe. Let him take
me up through the instrumentality of Jews, and place me
in such and such a spot; if not all his people will die.
However, he did not attend to the matter, and so many
people died. Now Jews were called upon, who buried
him with honour. The grave was of marble stone, and
upon the marble was a tablet, upon which was engraven, “I
am <persName xml:id="recogito-6d1ed2a6-1dd7-418c-98ff-bfa2a03a6454">Ezra</persName>, the scribe.” They buried him on the spot
named to the shepherd, and erected a fine structure over
his grave. In the eleventh hour a column of fire ascends</p>


            <pb n="39"/>
<p>
from his grave to the sky. This continues during the
eleventh and twelfth hour. It is also seen in the first
hour of the night. People can walk three or four para-
sangs by the light of the pillar. All the Ishmaelites wor¬
ship there. The keys of the houses over the graves are in
the hands of the Jews. They employ the proceeds of the
vows in giving marriage portions to orphans, supporting
disciples, and repairing synagogues of the poor.</p>

<p>
Before Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-a7bc34e3-95e2-4083-8cc2-1ee34394ea64">Petachia</persName> set out for the grave of <persName xml:id="recogito-55da73aa-5e9c-475b-84ea-9ba19b940afc">Ezra</persName>, the
scribe, he journeyed in eight days to <placeName ref="dare.ht.lu.se/places/22221" xml:id="recogito-866b4e3f-29c1-48da-a19f-4d66f0a5915a" cert="high">Shushan</placeName>,<note n="68"/> the former
capital. There are only two Jews there, who are dyers.
And he showed them the seal of the head of the academy,
and they showed him the <placeName xml:id="recogito-9a1fa82c-0ee0-45d1-a315-90c8c7c6958b" cert="unknown">coffin of Daniel.</placeName><note n="69"/> Originally he
was buried on one side of the river, and there was there
great plenty, prosperity, and blessing. Then those on the
other side of the river said, Because the righteous man is
not buried in our portion therefore our district is not
blessed. And there were constantly great wars between
the two districts, during which the coffin was violently
transferred from bank to bank. At last some elders came,
who having brought about a settlement between them, they
took the coffin and suspended it by iron chains, on high
iron pillars, erected in the middle of the river. The
coffin is made of polished copper conspicuous in the middle
of the river ten cubits above the water. At the distance it
looks lustrous like glass. The Jews told him that any
vessel passing underneath the coffin will proceed in safety
if those in it be pious, but will founder if this be not the</p>


            <pb n="41"/>
<p>
case. He was further told that underneath the coffin
there are fish with golden pendants in their ears.<note n="70"/> He,
however, did not pass underneath the coffin, but stood on
the brink of the river looking at the coffin.</p>

<p>
He then returned to <placeName ref="dare.ht.lu.se/places/33884" xml:id="recogito-7c37ff5c-b7e1-4169-82b2-e36216df6ec3" cert="high">Bagdad</placeName>. There he was shown a
flying camel.<note n="71"/> It is low, and its legs are slender; and if
anybody wishes to ride on it, he must tie himself to it lest
he should fall down. The rider traverses in one day the
space over which a man on foot would have to pass fifteen
days. One might go even swifter if the rider only could
stand it. In one second it gallops a mile. They also
showed him the <placeName xml:id="recogito-256c99b3-cc77-4fea-a626-648cdc92956d" cert="unknown">gates of Bagdad</placeName>. They are a hundred
cubits high and ten cubits wide. They are of polished
copper, and ornamented with figures, so that no one can
produce the like. A nail once fell out, and no artificer is
able to fix it again. Formerly the horses used to be
startled back at the sight of the gates, for seeing the
brightness of the gates they perceived as it were other
horses running towards them, whereby they took fright
and started off. They therefore poured boiling vinegar
over the gates, and thus deadened the brightness of the
polished copper, so that the horses should enter. How¬
ever, the polish of the copper is still partly perceived at
the top, where no vinegar was poured. <placeName xml:id="recogito-ed21a7df-0baa-4d37-8969-fc45d8ee1f5b" cert="unknown">These gates are
of the gates of Jerusalem</placeName>. The head of the academy has
many servants. They flog any one not immediately ex¬
ecuting his orders; therefore people fear him. He, how¬
ever, is righteous, humble, and full of knowledge of the</p>

Rabbi <persName xml:id="recogito-1f00ab52-f900-407b-8588-dde7f5e75498">Petachia</persName> travelled in two days from <placeName ref="dare.ht.lu.se/places/33884" xml:id="recogito-3cfe7cec-6688-4946-881a-2b82f05e9720" cert="high">Bagdad</placeName> to

house of <persName xml:id="recogito-8e7aeb41-9284-402f-9d17-f44262b16da8">Daniel</persName> looks as if it were new. On the place
where <persName xml:id="recogito-892c29b9-c511-4aa5-aea6-3510dbf6e295">Daniel</persName> used to sit there is a stone, and where his
feet rested a marble stone. There is also a stone at the
top, upon which the book lay out of which he used to
write. In the wall between the house of <persName xml:id="recogito-bff5154e-4031-4451-8199-f6f1e0d28537">Daniel</persName> and that
of <persName xml:id="recogito-5698ac88-b535-4793-b890-0c1744097b43">Nebuchadnezzar</persName> is a small window through which he
threw writings. There are steps below, upon which three
pious sages used to sit before him. On his right, by his
seat, a stone is fixed, and they declared that there was a
tradition that there the vessels from the holy temple were
hidden. One day rulers who had heard of it came for
the purpose of digging there ; but when they laid hold on
the stone they all fell down dead, therefore they did not
remove anything. They then went from that room, and
took him through the thickness of the wall to an upper
room, wherein <persName xml:id="recogito-d10d2f26-3b06-4b30-a6a4-bb9811125a11">Daniel</persName> used to offer up his prayers. The
entrance is so inclined that it is exactly opposite <placeName ref="sws.geonames.org/281184" xml:id="recogito-4e9d606c-295c-40e5-ba41-482afe8a830e" cert="high">Jerusalem</placeName>,
and it is so artificially made that nobody could point it
out.</p>

<p>
He then returned. He stated that he did not see any
woman whilst staying in <placeName ref="pleiades.stoa.org/places/893951" xml:id="recogito-7d32cf5b-176c-445f-a4b3-788b01f6db0c" cert="low">Babylon</placeName>, because they were all

yard; and no one offered up his prayer before he had
bathed. All travellers there travel in the night, on ac¬
count of the heat. Everything grows there in winter as
here in summer. Most of their labours are performed
during the night. <placeName ref="pleiades.stoa.org/places/893951" xml:id="recogito-54f716ca-e6d7-4914-b2d5-9b1c3dca45f4" cert="low">Babylon</placeName> is, in fact, quite a different
world. The Jews are devoted to the study of the law and
the fear of God. The Ishmaelites also are trustworthy.
When a merchant arrives there he deposits his goods in a
house and goes away. The goods are then offered for sale
in the market-places. If the price demanded by the mer¬

sold. All that is done with honesty.</p>

whom the head of the academy bids to do so acts as pre¬
centor. It is done in this manner. Some one recites the
hundred benedictions, and those present say Amen ; then
some one recites the prayer of Baruch Sheamar<note n="73"/> with a loud
voice, another rises and recites all the Praises, who is
joined by the whole congregation; his voice, however, is
heard above them all that they should not recite too fast,
and they all follow him. He recites the prayer of Yeshta-
bach before Vayosha, and then goes on with the other
prayers. Thus the prayer is divided between several pre¬
centors. No one talks to his neighbour at synagogue; all
stand decorously, and they are all at synagogue without
shoes, barefooted. When, whilst practising, they should</p>


            <pb n="47"/>
<p>
be mistaken in a tune, the head of the academy gives
them a sign with his finger; they then understand what is
the tune. If there be any young man having a pleasing
voice he recites a psalm. On the half-holidays<note n="74"/> they recite
the psalms with the accompaniment of musical instruments,
and they know by tradition with what tunes.<note n="75"/> For the Asor
they have ten tunes, and for the Shemineth eight tunes ;<note n="76"/>
they have several tunes for each psalm. When <persName xml:id="recogito-4af988e1-c561-4f46-9c33-c02539fbe44f">Rabbi Petachia</persName> was in the room of <persName xml:id="recogito-3214185f-c9e1-4e10-b801-fdde2339933b">Daniel</persName> they showed him a

there, for it has decayed. The mountains are full of
thorns and other herbs; when the dew falls upon them,
manna falls upon them, but when the sun shines warm it
melts. Whatever portion of it is gathered in the night, if
it be kept, likewise melts. They therefore carry off the
manna together with the thorns and herbs, which they are
obliged to cut off, since they are very hard. It is white like
snow. The herbs and nettles are very bitter. However,
when boiled together with the manna they become sweeter
than honey and every other sweet stuff. Were it boiled
without the nettles the limbs of the partaker thereof
would become disjointed for excessive sweetness. They
look like small grains. They gave him a few to taste;
they melted in his mouth; they were sweet; penetrating
into all his limbs, so that he could not bear the sweetness.<note n="81"/></p>

the brightness ascending from the grave of Baruch, son of
Neriah, and whose beautiful and splendid praying scarf
was faintly visible between the marble stones, went after¬
wards to the city of <placeName xml:id="recogito-c0abaaf7-f8ad-431d-845a-a8a13fe69f86" cert="low">Meccah</placeName>, to the tomb of <persName xml:id="recogito-d8424385-baae-4e1c-9e0d-93cf864ac0a5">Mahomet</persName> ;<note n="83"/>
and behold there was a decayed and putrefied corpse, from
whose grave such a disagreeable smell arose that nobody
could bear it. He then said to his people that there was
nothing substantial either in <persName xml:id="recogito-d0bfe333-b435-4a60-ac55-7d69160918ae">Mahomet</persName> or his religion,
for they knew that the body of Baruch, son of Neriah,
was preserved, that his praying scarf protruded from his
tomb, that he was a disciple to a prophet, and that the
Ishmaelites who dug up his grave perished, whilst the
Jews were not hurt; therefore we may know that the
Jews hold by the law kept by Baruch, son of Neriah.
He, however, could not gain time to convert himself
and his people before he died, and thus the resolution of
converting all his people became void.</p>

for the water does not come from the bottom, as it only
occurs in honour of a man of worth, since to an unworthy
man the water does not appear. Though one should
draw from the stone a thousand jugs of water, it would

urged him until he pointed it out. The king was a friend
of the Jews, and said, I will build here a temple, and
none but Jews shall pray therein. He built the temple of
marble stone, a beautiful structure consisting of red, green,

images in it; but they fell down. They then fixed the
images in the thickness of the wall; but in the holy of
holies they could not place any.<note n="105"/> <placeName xml:id="recogito-e1ccc3ac-a427-4bd7-bb89-07040240e8e6" ana="#reference" cert="unknown">The hospital</placeName><note n="106"/> where

through this gate, and that through it it would return. It
